    "## Task\n",
    "The task is to use the provided dataset to make a prediction if a loan application will be approved or denied. The data is available at [Loan Prediction Dataset](https://github.com/PayelGanguly96/Loan-Prediction). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Contents\n",
    "There are 2 notebooks:\n",
    "- [**1_PreProcess_Model_Serialize**](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/published/deployingML/1_PreProcess_Model_Serialize.ipynb): This is the original pre-processing flow, model creation and serialization. However, Flask API's require base packages within python. For this reason, I re-visited the pipeline creation in the next notebook.\n",
    "- [**2_Model_Serialization_Specific**](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/published/deployingML/2_Model_Serialization_Specific.ipynb): In this notebook, I specifically re-work the pre-processing flow to contain python base packages. \n",
    "    - When the `app` is started within `Flask`, this allows for POST method available at http://0.0.0.0:5000/predict.\n",
    "    - Response is a `json` with a dictionary of the predicted outcomes for the dataset where $1$ is *Approved* abd $0$ is *Denied*. "
