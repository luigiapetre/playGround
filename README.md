This is me playing around with python, R, matlab and anything which I find [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

## [Simulating a queue in a post office (py)](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/tree/master/queueing)

The problem is to simulate a queue within a post-office as follow:

>*At a post office, customers enter a single line waiting to be served by any one of two clerks. Every minute there is a 60% chance that a new customer arrives. If there is no one in line and a server is free, the customer does not wait to be served. When a customer is being served there is a 25% chance every minute that they complete their business and leave. When the clerk is free he will take the next customer in line, in the order that they arrived. Every minute, there is a 5% chance that a person standing in line will give up and leave. The post office is always open (24/7/365). Note: For simplicity you can assume customers will always arrive at the beginning of the minute and if they leave they do so at the end of the minute.*

I had originally put together some [Octave code](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/queueing/queueing.m) for this problem, but I converted to [python](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/queueing/queueing.ipynb).
