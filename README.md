Python, R, matlab and anything which I find [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) 

# Top Notebooks:
1. 2019-Mar: [Employing a Churn Prediction and Customer Value Prediction model to increase sales]()
1. 2019-Mar: [Machine Learning Templates]() These are a set of notebooks I use to perform my first pass of model selection in a POC. They test out different ```sklearn``` models, tuning of hyper-parameters via GridSearchCV and finally create an ensemble of models to improve model performance.
1. 2019-Jan: [Deploying ML Classifier as an API using Flask (py)](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/published/deployingML/0_readme.ipynb) In these set of notebooks, I put together an API with Flask to be used in production.
1. 2018-Dec: [iGaming Analytics - Early Customer Classifier (py)](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/published/iGamingAnalytics/0_readme.ipynb)  Performed an EDA on an iGaming dataset and put together a Customer Classification Model.
 
# Other Notebooks
## Data Science Projects
- 2018-May: [Predicting the results for the 2018 Fifa World Cup (py)](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/published/WorldCup2018Predictions/00_intro.ipynb) I tried using ML to predict the outcome of the 2018 Fifa World Cup. This project was not completed as I stopped half-way through the prediction modelling. However, some interesting result came out from the EDA and Feature Engineering in Notebook 2
- 2017-Feb: [House price prediction for the Maltese Market (R)](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/published/maltaHousePricing/00_MaltaHousePrices.ipynb) This project was put together for the [Data X - An Introduction to Data Science: Storage, Visualisation and Analysis](https://www.um.edu.mt/courses/studyunit/las3004). This was one of my first attempts at doing DS work and utilised R. 
   
## Visualisations and EDA
- 2019-Mar: [Malta Property Bubble Analysis](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/published/maltaPropertyBubble/propertyBubble.ipynb)  This is a mini-notebook were I try to quantify if Malta is currently (2019-Q1) in a property bubble. To do this, I use data from NSO and CBM and plot everything excel.
- 2017-Jun: [Efficiency frontier and Dash (py)](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/published/EFT/00_readme_eft.ipynb)  This is an initial draft for an app which calculates the Markowitz's Efficiency Frontier for a Portfolio Investment Firm.
- 2017-Feb: [Chess analytics (R)](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/published/chessAnalytics/ChessAnalytics.ipynb) Kingbase is a database of 1.8 million chess games which is freely available for download in Portable Game Notation (PGN) format. Using this data, I prepared a set of visualizations which summarize and explain information contained within.

## Miscellaneous  
- 2018-Mar: [Approximate Pi numerically using Monte Carlo Simulations (py)](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/published/monteCarloSimPi/MonteCarloPi.ipynb) This is a very short, neat notebook in which I put together a means to approximate $\pi$ numerically using Monte Carlo simulations.
- 2018-Jan: [Hash Code 2018 Pizza Slicer Practice Problem (py)](to be added)
- 2016-Jun: [Simulating a queue in a post office (py)](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/published/Queueing/Queueing.ipynb) At a post office, customers enter a single line waiting to be served by any one of two clerks. There have different probabilities of being served and I try and simulate the office's working hours.
